I'm Rin -- the author of Shattered Stars. I don't really consider myself much of an author, but I hope you enjoy what I write nonetheless.

I'm 18 and a highschool senior, currently, and I've recently found myself incredibly into Chinese webnovels, which is an odd thing to be into, probably, but oh well. You might be able to catch me with my rainbow pill flair over at [/r/noveltranslations](https://reddit.com/r/noveltranslations), going by the name Asterne.

I do a lot of programming, and currently know the following languages: Java, Javascript, Python, C, and C++. I'm working on learning Lua and expanding my knowledge of C and C++ right now.

I have a Huion drawing tablet that I do what could questionably be called digital art on occasionally, but I don't post it anywhere because it's pretty bad.

I'm American, 6"1', a Pisces, and, whether you'd believe it from my height or not, a girl.
