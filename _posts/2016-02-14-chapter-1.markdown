##### Jessica  
My head slams against the bunk above me, my head blanking and all of my senses shooting to life.

_Damnit. I still haven't gotten used to that._

Shrugging off my pounding headache as well as I can, I force my feet down onto the cold floor, change into my uniform, and rush out the door, not even taking a moment to say goodbye to the Barracks, knowing it'd be my last morning waking up in its thin, cold bunks.

The past few days we'd been going through testing so that we could get matched with our partner, who would be our roommate while we were in school, and our "crime-fighting partner" for life.
