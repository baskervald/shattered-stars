### Hi all! I'm Rin.

I'm the author of this story (although said author isn't actually _verifiably_ good at writing, so sorry about that -- you'll see if you think I am soon enough I guess). If I'm being entirely honest, the other day I just sat down and thought, "Hm, you know what would be nice? Writing a superhero academy story." So now I'm doing it.

The reason this is hosted on a github blog is because I'm an actual mega-nerd who programs in her spare time.
